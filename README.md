# Sudoku_Solver_By_CNN
Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. This can also be done by using backtracking.  
Here in this project Sudoku can be solved by backtracking algorithm.  
Input can be taken by its image by using cnn and opencv   
First the sudoku puzzle will be detected in the image  
Then the digits in the sudoku will be added to the array by cnn model
Then by backtracking algorithm the sudoku will be solved and result will be displayed and stored in Results folder
